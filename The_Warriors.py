# One day, on a typical spring afternoon, Sir Ronald has been looking around his land, riding a horse.
# Nothing foretold troubles, when suddenly Sir Ronald heard a scream for help, coming from somewhere nearby:
# - "Help! Help!" - shouted a piercing young girl's voice.
# As a true knight, Sir Ronald couldn’t stay away and went to the lady’s rescue. Rushing in the direction
# from which the cry came, he saw a carriage. The girl peered out the window hoping to see someone who could help her.
# - "Stop!"- ordered Sir Ronald to the coachman. - "By what right are you on my land?"
# The coachman didn’t get a chance to open his mouth, as his master came out of the carriage.
# - "My respects, noble sir. I had no idea that this land is yours. My bride and I were just going to my estate,
# not wanting to give anyone any trouble. "
# - "A flat-out lie! I'm not his bride!" - the girl exclaimed from the window.
# - "Explain yourself, Sir. What does that mean?",- said Sir Ronald.
# - "Of course. The king of a neighboring country has promised his daughter and half his kingdom to the one who’ll
# save her from the outlaws who took her. I’ve defeated those bastards and now I’m taking the princess to her father. "
# - "It's not true! They were in on it together They’ve kidnapped me on his order! I saw how he paid them
# a bag of gold!" - The princess didn’t stop taking for a second, trying to quickly describe the situation to
# the miraculously appeared savior.
# - "Such behavior is unworthy of a knight! Prepare to die!",- exclaimed Sir Ronald, drawing his sword.
# - "Ha-ha-ha, simple-hearted nobleman! We’ll see about that..."

# I'm sure that many of you have some experience with computer games. But have you ever wanted to change the game so
# that the characters or a game world would be more consistent with your idea of the perfect game? Probably, yes.
# In this mission (and in several subsequent ones, related to it) you’ll have a chance "to sit in the developer's
# chair" and create the logic of a simple game about battles.

# Let's start with the simple task - one-on-one duel. You need to create the class Warrior , the instances of
# which will have 2 parameters - health (equal to 50 points) and attack (equal to 5 points), and 1 property - is_alive,
# which can be True (if warrior's health is > 0) or False (in the other case). In addition you have to create the
# second unit type - Knight, which should be the subclass of the Warrior but have the increased attack - 7. Also you
# have to create a function fight() , which will initiate the duel between 2 warriors and define the strongest of them.
# The duel occurs according to the following principle:
# Every turn, the first warrior will hit the second and this second will lose his health in the same value as the
# attack of the first warrior. After that, if he is still alive, the second warrior will do the same to the first one.
# The fight ends with the death of one of them. If the first warrior is still alive (and thus the other one is
# not anymore), the function should return True , False otherwise.

# Input: The warriors.
#
# Output: The result of the duel (True or False).
#
# How it is used: For computer games development.
#
# Precondition:
# 2 types of units
# All given fights have an end (for all missions).
